# ColorFilter_HSV
## Situation
Generally there are 6 basic emotions in human's feeling: Happiness, Surprise, Anger, Disgust, Fear, Sadness. 
Color can be a representation of emotions in many cultures. But single colors are not accurate enough to express all the emotions.
Therefore in this program, I selected 5 sets of color combinations to represent each emotion except Surprise.

**(Surprise is regarded as an emotion that can be not be expressed or represented by color in many researches. )**

## Color Mode
The color combinations are designed based on a Japanese color study. Since HSV color mode is close to human's perception, here 
I applied HSV color mode. 

## Input
Two arguments are needed.
